# Fish Audio on RunAPI

Generate synchronous MP3 speech with `s1` or `s2-pro`. Use the target-language SDK for application integration and the `runapi` CLI for one-off speech generation or manual verification.

## Critical: Integration Runtime

- Integration work (app, backend, worker, library, Rails service, Node service, Go service, webhook pipeline, or production codebase) uses the **SDK integration path** for the target language.
- One-off generation, manual smoke tests, debugging, or user-requested CLI runs use the **CLI path** with the `runapi` binary. For full CLI-specific agent guidance, see https://github.com/runapi-ai/cli-skill.
- Never shell out to the `runapi` CLI as the production runtime integration layer.

## SDK integration path

When integrating Fish Audio into an application or production workflow, check the current SDK package and official usage. Confirm the install command, synchronous `run` method, request fields, managed audio response, and error classes before using CLI help or raw HTTP examples. Use a RunAPI SDK package:

- JavaScript / TypeScript: `@runapi.ai/fish-audio`
- Python: `runapi-fish-audio`
- Ruby: `runapi-fish-audio`
- Go: `github.com/runapi-ai/fish-audio-sdk/go`
- Java: `ai.runapi:runapi-fish-audio`
- PHP: `runapi-ai/fish-audio`

The synchronous `text_to_speech` resource accepts `model` and `text` and returns a completed response with RunAPI-managed `audios`.

## CLI path

The `runapi` binary is the one-off and manual testing runtime dependency. For full CLI-specific agent guidance, see https://github.com/runapi-ai/cli-skill. Run `runapi auth status` first. Prefer `RUNAPI_API_KEY` or import a token with `printf '%s' "$RUNAPI_API_KEY" | runapi auth import-token --token -`.

Inspect current fields before creating a request:

```shell
runapi fish-audio --help
runapi fish-audio text-to-speech --help
runapi fish-audio text-to-speech --input-file request.json
```

The request file contains only `model` and `text`; voice-cloning fields are not supported. The command returns one completed response, so do not add `--async` or call `runapi wait`.

## Variants

- `s1`: https://runapi.ai/models/fish-audio/s1.md
- `s2-pro`: https://runapi.ai/models/fish-audio/s2-pro.md

## Result handling

The response contains `id`, `status`, and one `audios` entry with `url`, `format`, `mime_type`, and `size_bytes`. The URL points to RunAPI-managed storage. Keep API keys in `RUNAPI_API_KEY` or saved RunAPI config.
